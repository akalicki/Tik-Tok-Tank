# Tik Tok Tank

Tik Tok Tank is a fun grid-based shooter I wrote for the Game Design and 
Artificial Intelligence class I took my senior year in high school. It 
features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and tanks can be 
controlled using the keyboard or XBOX 360 controllers. Computer players 
feature very limited artificial intelligence and my own modified 
implementation of [Dijkstra's algorithm][dijkstra] to help them navigate 
through the maze of blocks and find the human player using the shortest path 
possible.

I created all the graphics for the game using Photoshop, and the 
background music is a loop provided along with a library of professional 
quality sound-effects in the companion CD to 
[The Gamemaker's Apprentice][game making].
